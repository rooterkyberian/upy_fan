# upy_fan
micropython fan controller


# Hardware

* Wemos D1
* DHT11 temperature-humidity sensor
* Equation IR controlled fan (the IR daughter board with button has been replaced with Wemos D1)

It is important that the fan was originally controlled by IR remote, because it meant it had solid state variable speed control.
After testing it with multimeter it appeared the daughter board controlled main motor with signal varying from 2 to 5V (max speed).
